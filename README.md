## 🎨 Design

The design for this project was sourced from **Frontend Mentor**.

I chose to use **Styled Components** to deepen my understanding of **CSS-in-JS**, exploring its advantages in modular styling, dynamic theming, and component-based architecture.

## 🔮 Future Improvements

- ✨ **Add animations and transitions** using **Motion** for a smoother UI experience.
- 🔍 **Implement job filtering functionality** to dynamically sort and search for listings.
- 📊 **Fetch real job data from an API** instead of static JSON data.
